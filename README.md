# Advent of Code 2020

## Day 01
Double Triple trouble. Find (two | tree) entries in a list that sum up to 2020,
and return their product.

Solved with nested loops, but still decreasing the search space due to part of
the list already sought by the outer loops.

Could have sorted first and do a binary search

## Day 02
Count 'em!. Given a list of passwords, where a password contains a list of
characters, a needle, and an (occurrence | position) requirement, how many
passwords fulfill the requirement?

Solved with some funky parse due to splitting

## Day 03
Tree's. Given a map of squares and trees, walk the map and count how many trees
you encounter. Walking the map is based on a number of steps going down and
right. Oh, and the map infinitely repeats itself.

Solved by emulating infinity with the modulo operator. Beware of off by one
errors, though.

## Day 04
TODO...
